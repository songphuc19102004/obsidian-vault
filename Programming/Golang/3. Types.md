# Structures

### Defining a structure
```go
type Sample struct {
	field string
	a, b int
}
```

### Instantiating a structure
```go
data := Sample{"word", 1, 2}

data := Sample{
	field: "word",
	a:     1,
	b:     2,
}
```
- In the first way, we have to assign each field ***in order***

### Default values
```go
// field = ""
// a, b = 0
data := Sample{}

// field = "" 
// a = 5, b = 0
data := Sample{a: 5}
```
- Any fields not indicated during instantiation will have default values

### Accessing Fields
```go
word := data.field
a, b := data.a, data.b

data.field = "hello"
data.a = 10
data.b = 20
```
- Fields can be **read** from and **written** to

### Anonymous Structures

#### Example
```go
var sample struct {
	field string
	a, b int
}

sample.field = "hello"
sample.a = 9
```

```go
sample := struct {
	field string
	a, b int
}{
	"helo",
	1, 2,
}
```
- The main difference between the first and second way:
	- The first sample's fields will have default values if we don't supply any.
	- The second way, which use the **create-and-assign** operator, require us to declare the fields and assign them all at the same time, and we can't be missing any fields.
