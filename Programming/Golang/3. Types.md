# Structures
![[structure-definition.png]]
### Defining a structure
```go
type Sample struct {
	field string
	a, b int
}
```

### Instantiating a structure
```go
data := Sample{"word", 1, 2}

data := Sample{
	field: "word",
	a:     1,
	b:     2,
}
```
- In the first way, we have to assign each field ***in order***

### Default values
```go
// field = ""
// a, b = 0
data := Sample{}

// field = "" 
// a = 5, b = 0
data := Sample{a: 5}
```
- Any fields not indicated during instantiation will have default values

### Accessing Fields
```go
word := data.field
a, b := data.a, data.b

data.field = "hello"
data.a = 10
data.b = 20
```
- Fields can be **read** from and **written** to

### Anonymous Structures
![[structure-anonymous.png]]
#### Example
```go
var sample struct {
	field string
	a, b int
}

sample.field = "hello"
sample.a = 9
```

```go
sample := struct {
	field string
	a, b int
}{
	"helo",
	1, 2,
}
```
- The main difference between the first and second way:
	- The first sample's fields will have default values if we don't supply any.
	- The second way, which use the **create-and-assign** operator, require us to declare the fields and assign them all at the same time, and we can't be missing any fields.

### Recap

### Example code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Coordinates struct {
	x, y int
}

type Rectangle struct {
	topLeft  Coordinates // top left
	botRight Coordinates // bottom right
}

func calculatePerimeter(rect Rectangle) int {
	rectWidth := rect.topLeft.y - rect.botRight.y
	rectLength := rect.botRight.x - rect.topLeft.x

	return (rectWidth + rectLength) * 2
}

func calculateArea(rect Rectangle) int {
	rectWidth := rect.topLeft.y - rect.botRight.y
	rectLength := rect.botRight.x - rect.topLeft.x

	return rectWidth * rectLength
}

func printInfo(rect Rectangle) {
	fmt.Println("perimeter is:", calculatePerimeter(rect))
	fmt.Println("area is:", calculateArea(rect))
}

func main() {
	r := Rectangle{
		topLeft:  Coordinates{2, 3},
		botRight: Coordinates{6, 1},
	}

	printInfo(r)
}
```

# Arrays
![[array-definition.png]]

### Visualization
![[array-visualization.png]]
- This is a visualization of arrays in memory
- Id takes 2 bytes, storeCode takes 1 byte, rate takes 4 bytes, total of 7 bytes per item
- If we want to access the third element, we begin at index 0 and skip over 14 (7 * 2) bytes

### Creating an Array
```go
var arrName [numberOfItems]itemType

// array of 3 integers with default value 0
var myArray [3]int

myArr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}

// 3 dots (...) will look over the items and set the size (here, ... = 3)
// default way to make an array ✓
myArr := [...]int{1, 2, 3}

// fourth item will be 0
myArr := [4]int{1, 2, 3}
```
 - Elements not addressed in array initialization will be set to default values.
### Access Array Elements
```go
var myArray [3]int

myArray[0] = 7
myArray[1] = 5
myArray[2] = 4 

item1 := myArray[2]
```

### Iteration
```go
myArray := [...]int{1, 2, 3}

for i := 0; i < len(myArray); i++ {
	item := myArray[i]
	fmt.Println(item)
}
```
- Good practice to assign the element to a variable during iteration
	- Easier to read in large functions / nested loops

### Bounds
run-time error
```go
var myArray [3]int

for i:= 0; i < len(myArray); i++ {
	fmt.Println(myArray[i])
}
```

compile-time error
```go
var myArray [3]int

myArray[0] = 5

// error
myArray[3] = 4

// error
item := myArray[3]
```
- Attempting to access an element outside the bounds of an array will result in an error.

# Slices
> ***99 out of 100 times, you will use Slices instead of Arrays***
![[slices-definition.png]]
### Visualization
![[slices-visualization.png]]

![[slices-visualization1.png]]
- Arrays are **fixed-size**. Meaning that the data's address is **contiguous**. If we want to add new items to an Array, we will have to **override** the next address. 
- Slices instead will **copy** the current array's data and put it in another chunk of memory with **enlarged** array size, while slice's size will just increase based on number of items added. -> Slices use Array under the hood.

### Creating a Slice
Slices and an underlying array can be created at the same time.
```go
// oppose to array, we don't have anything inside the square brackets []
mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3}

// accessing elements in a slice is the same as an array
mySlice[0]
```
- Whenever the square brackets [] is empty, it creates an array, which will be size 3, and then it creates and give us a **slice**, which is a "view" into the size 3 array.

### Slice Syntax
Slice syntax can create slices from specific elements in an array  or other slice
```go
// lowIndex is inclusive
// highIndex is exclusive
slice[lowIndex:highIndex]

// example: slice[0, 5] will give you elements 0 -> 4
```
- Omitting **lowIndex** means "start at 0"
- Omitting **highIndex** means "to the end"

#### Example
![[slices-syntax-example.png]]
- It is an error to slice past the array length.

### Dynamic Arrays
![[slices-dynamic-arrays.png]]
- We have to reassign the the existing slices.

### Preallocation
![[slices-preallocation.png]]
- There will be many situations where you know about how many items that you need  ahead of time. We can preallocate the number of elements that we need. **This will save computation time.**
### Slices to Functions
Functions parameters which require a slice can work with slices of **any size**
```go
func iterate(slice []int) {
	for i := 0; i < len(slice); i++ {
		// ...
	}
}

func main() {
	small := []int{1}
	big := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
	iterate(small)
	iterate(big)
}
```

### Multidimensional Slices
![[slices-multidimensional.png]]
#### Visualization on the 2nd 
![[slices-multidimensional-visualize.png]]
- Let's access board[1],[2]. 1 would access the the row (b[1]), and 2 would access the column (third elements of []string at b[1]).
### Recap
![[slices-recap.png]]

# Ranges
```go
slice := []string{"Hello", "World", "!"}

// i is the index number
// element is the thing in the slice
for i, element := range slice {
	fmt.Println(i, element)

	// this loop go through each letter of each word
	// using %q, we print out a rune instead number of that rune
	for _, ch := range element {
		fmt.Printf("    %q\n", ch)
	}
}
// 0 Hello
// 1 World
// 2 !
```
![[range-result.png]]
- Range keyword will automatically create an iterator for us

With typical ***for*** loop, we can't go through letters in a string
```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
	// we can't do this
	slice[0][i]
}
```
- This isn't going to work because we are going through ***individual bytes*** of that string, and a letter can take up more than 1 byte in some cases (special characters, emojis,...)
- We are able to go through each letter in a word using the ***range*** keyword
- With range, we don't have to calculate the ***length***

# Maps
![[map-definition.png]]

### Making a Map
```go
// inside square brackets [] are data type for keys (string)
// outside square brackets [] are data type for values (int)
myMap := make(map[string]int)

myMap := map[string]int{
	"item 1": 1,
	"item 2": 2,
	"item 3": 3,
}
```
- With ***Maps***, we don't need to specify how any items we are adding, just list out all the items that we want.
- Size of ***Maps*** are dynamic.

### Map operations
![[map-operation.png]]

### Iteration
```go
myMap := make(map[string]int)

for key, value := range myMap {
	// ...
}
```
- Maps are ***unordered*** (random order). So every time we run this loop, chances are we will get ***different results*** because each time we run it, it will be in different order.

# Pointers
### Memory 
![[pointer-memory.png]]

### Pointers
![[pointer-definition.png]]
- ***Dereference: truy cập vào vùng nhớ mà một con trỏ trỏ tới***

### Creating Pointers
![[pointer-create.png]]
- Code on the right is shorter version of the left.
- We can read * int as pointer to integer 
- We can read &value as pointer to value
- Use asterisk( * ) when we are declaring that we need a pointer to something
- Use ampersand(&) when we want to create a pointer from something that already exists. 

### Using Pointers
![[pointer-using.png]]
- &i means ***pointer to i*** -> We are creating a variable that has a memory address that points to i (as in i := 1) => increment function will not have the copy of i but instead i itself
- It is important to dereferencing using asterisk( * ) since the x by itself is a memory address.
