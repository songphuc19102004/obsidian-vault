# Interfaces
![[interfaces-definition.png]]

### Creation & Implementation
```go
type MyInterface interface {
	Function1()
	Function2(x int) int
}

type MyType int
func (m MyType) Function1() {}
func (m MyType) Function2(x int) int {
	return x + x
}

func execute(i MyInterface) {
	i.Function1()
}
```

### Notes
![[interfaces-notes.png]]
- Note the keyword: **"has all receiver functions"**. Because this is not a Object-Oriented language, where interfaces are implemented by putting the required functions in an object, we have to "put" all interfaces in a **"type"** (receiver functions).
- Interfaces are already ***Pointers***

### Pass by Value vs Pass by Pointers
```go
type MyType int // already implemented MyInterface

func execute(i MyInterface) {
	i.Function1()
}

m := MyType(1)
execute(m)
execute(&m)
```
- When we have an Interface as a parameter, we can either use a ***copy*** or a ***pointer***. However, if we put the parameter as a Pointer (i \*MyInterface), then we would be restricted to just use the pointer as an argument. => We want to have ***value type*** when we have Interface as a parameter.

# Error Handling
![[error-handling-definition.png]]
- Go has no Exceptions => No try catch.

### Basics
![[error-handling-basics.png]]
### Error Interface
```go
type error interface {
	Error() string
}
```
- This is the Error interface in a std library

### Implementation
```go
type DivError struct {
	a, b int
}

func (d *DivError) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Cannot divide by zero: %d / %d", d.a, d.b)
}
```
- This is how we implement the Error interface.
- Always implement error as a ***receiver function***.
	- We always want to use ***Pointer Receiver*** when we implement error.
	- Prevents comparison problems if error is inspected. Since if we just compare the value, it will just check the data type DivError struct and will return true, even when a and b is different. By using pointers, they will compare the ***memory address***.

# Readers & Writers
![[reader-writer-definition.png]]

### Interfaces
```go
type Reader interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
- Read requires a slice of byte, returns number of bytes that were read and and error.
- Writer is the same as Read.

### Reader
![[reader-writer-reader.png]]
#### Example
![[reader-writer-reader-example.png]]
- Buffer acts as a temporary location to store something before we copy it into the final destination.
- We must check the EOF error to break out of the infinite loop.

#### Walkthrough
![[reader-writer-reader-walkthrough.png.png]]
- First thing we do is we create a Reader with the sample data within it (SAMPLE), which is the first line, reader := ...
- ***newString*** is of type strings.Builder, and we use it to write read string to
- Next, in the loop, we read some data into the buffer. We then take a chunk out of the buffer, based on the number of bytes read, then write to the string builder.
- We can see the M and P grey out. This is because on the second iteration, L and E was written into the buffer, but the buffer ***doesn't erase old data***, so we have to just take ***buffer\[:numbytes]*** to avoid taking old data.
=> This is a lot of code to just to read and write from a data source, so normally we would use the ***bufio*** package.

### bufio package
![[reader-writer-bufio.png]]

#### bufio.Scanner
![[reader-writer-bufio-scanner.png]]
- os.Stdin would just be our terminal input.

# Type Embedding
![[type-embedding-definition.png]]
- Type Embedding is basically ***Composition***.

### Embedded Interfaces
![[type-embedding-interfaces.png]]
- Propagate: lan truyền, truyền

#### Example
![[type-embedding-interfaces-example.png]]

### Embedded Structs
![[type-embedding-structs.png]]

#### Example
![[type-embedding-structs-example.png]]
![[type-embedding-structs-example2.png.png]]
- Note that we have 2 String() functions of Account and ManagerAccount. By default, we will have the String() function of Account. But since we created our own String() on the ManagerAccount, it will take priority (it will use the String() of ManagerAccount instead). But we can still access it by using ***ManagerAccount.Account.String()*** .

# Generics
![[generics-definition.png]]

### Syntax
![[generics-syntax.png]]

#### Example
![[generics-syntax-example.png]]
- comparable interface is one of the generic parameters that's provided as part of the standard library.
- Most of the time, the compiler will be able to figure out the type that's going too be used for the function. However, if it cannot, we can use the syntax of the last line, with the square brackets \[\].

### Creating a Constraint
![[generics-create-constraint.png]]
- constraints are just ***interfaces***.
- Integers32 interface can either take int32 **or*** uint32.

### Constraints and Type Aliases
![[generics-constraints-type-aliases.png]]

### Approximation
![[generics-approximation.png]]
- To solve the above issue, we use ***approximation***.
- ***approximation*** can be specified by using tilde (~) prior to type name.
- All this will do is anything that happens to be an ***int32*** or ***uint32***, regardless of the actual name, will be considered part of the ***Integers32*** interface.
