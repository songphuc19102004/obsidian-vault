# Receiver Functions
![[receiver-function-definition.png]]
- Receiver functions are functions that are associated with existing data structures. This allows us to use a dot notation with the data structure.

### Regular Function
![[receiver-function-regular.png]]
- As we can see, we use shiftBy() exclusively.

### Receiver Function
![[receiver-function-receiver.png]]
- As we can see, we use shiftBy() by using dot notation (.) of coord
- Inside the first parentheses () is the **data structure** we want to operate on (here is Coordinate) -> This function operates on a pointer to a Coordinate  => shiftBy() function is applied to all Coordinate.

### Receiver Function (Value)
- The previous used a pointer receiver. This is a **value receiver**.
- When we use a pointer on receiver function, we are operating on an existing structure. If we use a value receiver, we are going to create a copy of the structure and operate that copy.

# iota
![[iota-definition.png]]
- iota is used when we work with ***constants***.
- Instead of writing each number for each constants, we can use **'iota'** keyword. This keyword will automatically assign the values that are present.
- The first constant (Online) is put to be equal to iota, which will be equal to 0. Every constants after **'iota'** is going to be increment from that zero by 1.

# Variadics
There will be situations where we write a function and we won't know how many parameters that we need ahead of time. It is possible to write a function that accepts any numbers of parameters.
=> Variadics are a way to make function that **accepts any numbers of parameters**.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := []int{1, 2, 4, 6}
	b := []int{7, 8, 9}

	all := append(a, b...)

	answer := sum(all...)
	fmt.Println(answer)
}

func sum(numbers ...int) int {
	sum := 0
	for _, n := range numbers {
		sum += n
	}
	return sum
}
```
- numbers is a ***slice of integers***
- the sum() function actually only takes a sequence of integers as argument. For example: sum(1, 4, 5, 8 ,9). It does not take a slice of integers as arguments. But we can overcome this problem by using 3 dots (...) behind the slice. The 3 dots (...) unpacks the slice into individual arguments.

# Text Formatting: fmt
### fmt Package
![[text-formatting-fmt.png]]

### Printf
Common verbs
![[text-formatting-printf.png]]
- %c can be used to print out a Rune. Since a Rune is just a number, if we try to print it with %v, we will get number.
- %X can be used to get the hex code of a number. If we have the number 10, we will get A back for Hex. 
- %U will print out the data in Unicode Format

### Escape Sequences
![[text-formatting-escape-seq.png]]
- Unicode is \u or \U. It allows us to inline a Unicode character by using the code point value. For example, \u then the number for that particular character we want to display.
- \x can be useful if we are trying to make a ***network packet***. We can just paste the bytes after \x. It does have to be in **Hex format**.
### Example Printf
```go
fmt.Printf("Hello, world!\n")
fmt.Printf("This is a \"Quote\"\n")
```

```go
func surround(msg string, left, right rune) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%c%v%c", left, msg, right)
}

surrounded := surround("this message", '(', ')')
fmt.Println(surrouded)
// (this message)
```

# Packages
- The ***main*** package and the ***func main()*** is the entry point of the program.
- In a package, if a function starts with a ***Capital Letter***, it's going to be exported (public). So it will be available outside the package it resides. On the other hand, if a function start with ***normal case letter***, it will be not visible outside the package (private). 
- The path to import a package must begin with the module name (decided in the go.mod), and go from root directory (where go.mod resides).
  For example:
go.mod
```go
module coursecontent

go 1.18
```

msg.go
```go
import (
	"coursecontent/demo/pkg/display"
)
```
- If we have a directory called ***msg***, and inside the directory we have 2 go files, then if we import the ***msg*** package, it will just smash 2 go files into one package

# Testing
![[testing-definition.png]]
- Regression, in the context of software testing, refers to a situation where previously working functionality stops working after changes or updates are made to the code. Essentially, it's when new code inadvertently reintroduces old bugs or creates new issues that affect existing features.

### Setup
![[testing-setup.png]]
- Ending a file's name with ***\_test.go*** tells the go test command that this file contains test functions.

#### Example: Setup
![[testing-setup-example.png]]

![[testing-setup-example2.png]]
- It's a convention to put **Test** before the name of the functions we are testing.
- Argument for the test functions always has to be ***t testing.T*** (We can change name of t)
- To indicate a test failure, we use ***t.Errorf***
- The error output pattern usually is: "function_name(data_supplied)=answer_we_got, answer_we_want"
#### Example: Run test
![[testing-run.png]]

### Available Testing Function
![[testing-available-functions.png]]
- Normally we would use the version that provides messages (**Errorf()**, **Fatalf()**)  
- **Fail()** or **Errorf()** will continue to run tests even if one fails. While **FailNow()** or **Fatalf()** don't.
- **Logf()** will log information to the terminal, but only when the test fails.
