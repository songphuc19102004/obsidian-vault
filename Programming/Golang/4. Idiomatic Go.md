# Receiver Functions
![[receiver-function-definition.png]]
- Receiver functions are functions that are associated with existing data structures. This allows us to use a dot notation with the data structure.

### Regular Function

- As we can see, we use shiftBy() exclusively.

### Receiver Function
![[receiver-function-receiver.png]]
- As we can see, we use shiftBy() by using dot notation (.) of coord
- Inside the first parentheses () is the **data structure** we want to operate on (here is Coordinate) -> This function operates on a pointer to a Coordinate  => shiftBy() function is applied to all Coordinate.

### Receiver Function (Value)
- The previous used a pointer receiver. This is a **value receiver**.
- When we use a pointer on receiver function, we are operating on an existing structure. If we use a value receiver, we are going to create a copy of the structure and operate that copy.
