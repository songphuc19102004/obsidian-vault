# Receiver Functions
![[receiver-function-definition.png]]
- Receiver functions are functions that are associated with existing data structures. This allows us to use a dot notation with the data structure.

### Regular Function
![[receiver-function-regular.png]]
- As we can see, we use shiftBy() exclusively.

### Receiver Function
![[receiver-function-receiver.png]]
- As we can see, we use shiftBy() by using dot notation (.) of coord
- Inside the first parentheses () is the **data structure** we want to operate on (here is Coordinate) -> This function operates on a pointer to a Coordinate  => shiftBy() function is applied to all Coordinate.

### Receiver Function (Value)
- The previous used a pointer receiver. This is a **value receiver**.
- When we use a pointer on receiver function, we are operating on an existing structure. If we use a value receiver, we are going to create a copy of the structure and operate that copy.

# iota
![[iota-definition.png]]
- iota is used when we work with ***constants***.
- Instead of writing each number for each constants, we can use **'iota'** keyword. This keyword will automatically assign the values that are present.
- The first constant (Online) is put to be equal to iota, which will be equal to 0. Every constants after **'iota'** is going to be increment from that zero by 1.

# Text Formatting: fmt
### fmt Package
![[text-formatting-fmt.png]]

### Printf
Common verbs
![[text-formatting-printf.png]]
- %c can be used to print out a Rune. Since a Rune is just a number, if we try to print it with %v, we will get number.
- %X can be used to get the hex code of a number. If we have the number 10, we will get A back for Hex. 
- %U will print out the data in Unicode Format

### Escape Sequences
![[text-formatting-escape-seq.png]]
- Unicode is \u or \U. It allows us to inline a Unicode character by using the code point value. For example, \u then the number for that particular character we want to display.
- \x can be useful if we are trying to make a ***network packet***. We can just paste the bytes after \x. It does have to be in **Hex format**.
### Example Printf
```go
fmt.Printf("Hello, world!\n")
fmt.Printf("This is a \"Quote\"\n")
```

```go
func surround(msg string, left, right rune) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%c%v%c", left, msg, right)
}

surrounded := surround("this message", '(', ')')
fmt.Println(surrouded)
// (this message)
```
