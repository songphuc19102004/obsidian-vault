# Why Go?
![[Pasted image 20250325033008.png]]
- Package registry is similar to the JS NPM ecosystem.

# Technical Features
![[Pasted image 20250325033200.png]]
- Backend programming such as Web Servers
- GC overhead is very minimal.

### Packages & Modules
![[Pasted image 20250325033847.png]]
- Some example of packages are:
	- Argument parsing
	- Drawing graphics
	- Handing HTTP requests
	For each of these packages, we would just wanted to do the **single task** that it was **designed** for. If we want to do something else, we can just create a new package.

#### Using packages
![[Pasted image 20250325034206.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250325034300.png]]
- By default, whenever we import a package in Go, if we want to use it, we have to refer to the package's name. (**fmt**.Print()). We can use '.' before the package to import all the funcs to our code
- We can rename the package's imports if it's too long by putting a name before the package

#### Modules
![[Pasted image 20250325034658.png]]
- Modules are created by having a **go.mod** file in the root directory

```go
module example.com/practice
go 1.17

require (
	github.com/alexflint/go-arg v1.4.2
	github.com/fatih/color v1.13.0
)
```
- namespace: example.com
- module name: pratice
- go version: 1.17

# Data types
![[Pasted image 20250325040051.png]]

### Data types in Go
![[Pasted image 20250325040141.png]]

### Primitive data types
![[Pasted image 20250325040246.png]]
- All primitive data types in Go are numeric: this means that they are simply a ***stream of bytes***.

### Some data types
#### Signed Integer Types
![[Pasted image 20250325040530.png]]

#### Unsigned Integer Types
![[Pasted image 20250325040606.png]]
- uintprt stands for unsigned integer pointer: that will be the pointer size under current architecture. On **64-bit** system, it will be **uint64**. On **32-bit** system, it will be **uint32**

#### Other Data Types
![[Pasted image 20250325040854.png]]
- float64: decimal point number with enhanced accuracy.

#### Type Aliases
![[Pasted image 20250325041041.png]]

```go
type nameProvided originalType
```
- Primary reason for doing this is to make your code ***easier to read***.

#### Type Conversions
![[Pasted image 20250325041325.png]]
- We just created a new type of UserId and new type of Speed

# String & Runes
### Text Encoding
![[Pasted image 20250325041720.png]]

#### Example of Code Page
![[Pasted image 20250325041759.png]]
- Looking at 'd', we are at code point 1 and 3 -> To create a lowercase 'd', it takes 2 bytes: 1 and 3
- In Go, when we work with strings and runes, we are actually working with ***individual bytes***, not letters themselves. => It's important to understand that a letter ***can consume more than 1 byte***

### Runes
![[Pasted image 20250325042157.png]] 
- We are always working with **numbers** when working with Runes

#### Rune Byte Representation
How a rune represented in memory:
![[Pasted image 20250325042331.png]]
- We have 2 green rectangles represent **int32**. Each of these blocks are **8 bits**, which adds up to **32 bits**. 1, 2, 3, 4 are the number of Bytes
- To represent the capital 'Q', we have 51 in the first Byte position.
- To represent the zigzag, we have this combination of Bytes, in these specific Byte locations.
=>  If we try to iterate over each letter, we will actually iterate over each one of these bytes, instead of the entire letter itself.

### Strings
![[Pasted image 20250325042921.png]]
- Null termination (like in C) is a technique to mark the end of a string, using '\0'. Explain:
```c
char greeting[] = "Hello";
```
The compiler actually creates an array of six characters: `'H'`, `'e'`, `'l'`, `'l'`, `'o'`, and `'\0'`. The `'\0'` is the null terminator.
- When iterating a string, iteration occurs over bytes, and bytes are not symbols.

#### String Byte Representation
How string represented in memory:
![[Pasted image 20250325043450.png]]
- Each one of these Runes has a specific bit length.
- String is just a combination of all of these Runes.
- This particular stringi s 9 bytes long, so if we iterate through a string, we go 1 byte at a time -> We won't have the same symbols since we split it.

#### How to create Runes
![[Pasted image 20250325043806.png]]
- We surround them with **single quote** ''. Here we are creating a Rune 'a', 'R', '7',...
- We will use backticks for symbols isn't on our keyboards.
- We will use Raw Literal when our strings have quotes in them or some special cases. Everything you type here will come out as-is.
