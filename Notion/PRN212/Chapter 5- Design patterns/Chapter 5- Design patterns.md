- A design pattern provides a ==**general reusable solution**== for the ==**common problems that occur in software design**==
- A design pattern i==**sn't a finished design**== that can be transformed directly into code. It is a ==**description or template**== for ==**how to solve a problem**== that can be used in many different situations
- Design patterns are ==**programming language independent**== strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation
- Design patterns are ==**not meant for project development**==. Design patterns are meant for ==**common problem-solving**== and whenever there is a need, we have to implement a suitable pattern to avoid such problems in the future
- The pattern typically ==**shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects**==
- By using the design patterns we can make our code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable
- The Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: ==**Creational, Structural, and Behavioral**==

  

## Why use DP?

- Speed up Development process
- Effective software design
- Reusing DP helps prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems
- Improve code readablity
- Often, we only understand how to ==**apply certain software design techniques to certain problems**==. These techniques are ==**difficult to apply to a broader range of problems**==
- Design patterns ==**provide general solutions**==, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem
- Patterns allow developers to ==**communicate using well-known, well understood names**== for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs
