What is Angular?

→ Angular is a **JavaScript Framework** which allows you to create reactive **Single-Page-Applications** (SPAs)

SPAs: One HTML file, and a bunch of JavaScript. Every changed is rendered in the browser → Gives the user a very reactive UX. JavaScript is much faster than having to reach out to a server for every page change. → ==**Only change currently loaded page**==

> **Angular, in the end is a JS Framework, changing your DOM(’HTML’) at runtime**

# What is TypeScript

- TS really is just a super set to JavaScript. Most important features: strong typing(avoid errors when writing code)
- TS doesn’t run in browsers → So it get compiled to JavaScript in the end(Handled by CLI)
