Recursive must have a base case (case where we return instead of continue the recursion)

Call stack (or Function call stack): Is when you calling a function within the function itself → It is recursive → It generates a function call stack (or recursive call stack) → Since it’s a stack, it’s building ==**UP**==

Therefore, ==**we always ask 2 questions:**==

- What is the base case? (When can we no longer continue?)
- What is the smallest amount of work we can do in each iteration?
